## MATH 213

MATH 213 (Basic Discrete Mathematics) is a 3-credit hour course that is an option to fulfill requirements for both electrical and computer engineers as part of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Core Curriculum. It is offered in the fall, spring, and summer semesters.

## Content Covered

Basic sets, theories, conjectures
Induction
Counting 
Discrete probability 
Advanced counting
Graphs
Trees

The course starts by covering the many different basic conjectures and terminology you need to understand discrete math. Course then moves from this relatively easier material into proofs by induction and counting numbers as it relates to previous units. From here, the concepts build upon each other till the course wraps up with the most applicable computer science concepts of graphs and trees. Some Big-O notation is briefly covered in the middle of the course but other than that this course mainly focuses on the mathematical side of Discrete. The next course after this would be CS 225 which starts right where this course leaves off with a quick overview before diving into newer content. 

## Prerequisites

The only prerequisite for this class is to take MATH 220/221 as this is intended as an early college math class. Future classes will expand on this content by diving deeper into specific topics, such as proofs, (CS 374) and mathematical analysis (CS 357).
​​When to Take it
MATH 213 is generally taken by computer engineering students in their first semester of sophomore year, and by electrical engineering students in their second semester of sophomore year. It is recommended to take MATH 213 as soon as possible, especially if the student is in or intending to transfer into computer engineering, in order to open up future coursework in the computer engineering curriculum, as every future course builds on at least one topic covered in the class. Some advanced students may prefer to move MATH 213 into a semester in their freshman year in order to take CS 225 (the main Data Structures class) as early as possible. 

## Course Structure

The class starts from the very basics of discrete mathematics. The initial two to three weeks stress basic terminology ranging from mapping, sets, comparing two numbers, etc. Afterward, the course material introduces proof by induction and counting theorems. The course analyzes various scenarios and each possibility where the different counting theorem could apply. The following month is where the course contains its most important applicable content by going through Big-O notation and how it applies to computer science. The final quarter of the class teaches students the more advanced areas of material covered previously. These area the areas tested on the final. The course then, in the last week, teaches graphs and trees as a foreshadowing to the future classes. 
The course has weekly homeworks assigned from textbooks that are graded based on correctness. The course has 3 lectures a week and no discussions or labs. There are typically 2 midterms and a final.  There are not very many practice exams on offer, so it is recommended to keep up with the homework for each week in order to maintain a proper understanding of the covered concepts. The main tools needed to do well in this class are going to class and doing the review sheet for each exam as review sheets are almost identical to exams. 
Instructors
The instructors for this course vary based on availability and student demand for each semester. This semester (Spring 2023), the instructor is Elizabeth Kelley but previous professors include Sergei Ivanov, Eric Samperton, Reuven Hodges. The professors tend to have backgrounds all over the mathematical spectrum, as this is an introductory class and thus covers a broad array of topics.

## Course Tips

Topics covered in this course are intended to not be super hard so by going to class and reviewing notes, you will likely feel you understand material. Do the homework on your own to ensure you gain a deep understanding of the math and you should be good for the exams in this class. 
Do not be afraid to ask questions in lecture! MATH 213 covers a vast amount of topics to provide a broad overview of math, so understanding the material will be helpful for every future technical, proof related CS course you have to take. Overall. MATH 213 is a straightforward class which you can succeed in as long as you put in the work. 

## Life After

After completing MATH 213, ECE students are encouraged to take CS 225, the main data structures and algorithm course, as soon as possible. CS 225 builds onto concepts introduced at the tail end of MATH 213, which in turn build on concepts covered throughout the rest of the course; therefore, having a strong understanding of MATH 213 material is important prior to taking CS 225. It is also recommended to review some Big-O notation over summer before you take CS 225 as Math 213 quickly goes over this important concept. CS 225 jumps fully into these topics right away so it is important to have a good grasp. 

## Infamous Topics

Induction: This topic is covered pretty early on in the course, generally within the first few weeks, and is the most commonly seen as the most challenging part of the course. The hard part is being able to see patterns in how the inductive step works so be sure to do many practice problems. 
Advanced Counting Techniques: This is covered towards the end of the semester, and is essentially the culmination of the semester as all the topics learned are combined here. The questions here can often be very twisted and hard to grasp the first time around as there may seem to be infinite ways to answer the question but a deep understanding of probability and number theory will allow you to be successful.
